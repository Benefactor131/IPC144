The workshop 2 helped me to comprehend such things as data types and how to give a type of data to a variable, in particular integral and floating-point types.

Also, I found out how to make simple arithmetic operations in C such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and remaindering. And I learned how to use ‘scanf’ command, which is used to read an input from the user.

What is more, I have learned how to convert operands from one data type to another, and this process is called casting. And this process helped me to figure out that conversion from floating-point value into integer value is the best practice when executing calculations. It is because, integer arithmetic is faster and easier than using decimals. 

Finally, one of the most useful things that I learned from this workshop is the modulo operation. And in some situations, it can be better to use modulus operator instead of division or subtraction. For instance, for finding a remainder it takes less steps to use modulus than it is to use division or subtraction.
