This workshop helped to learn about declaring aliases for constant variables with #define and how to create iteration constructs and where I can apply them. Also, the workshop 3 gave me the opportunity to practice the simplest selection construct which is optional path using an "if" command and learn about nesting one logic construct within another.

While doing this workshop I have not used pseudo-coding or flowcharting before making a solution. However, I regret skipping this step, because the process of making the code solution was unorganized and in the beginning I was confused where to start from. And making a pseudo-code beforehand could save my time spent on the workshop.

Basically, there are three types of iteration constructs: "while", "for" and "do-while". Nevertheless, in this program I used only two of them: "while" and "for" constructs, as they were more suitable for this particular task, since they do not have a drawback which "do-while" has. The minus of "do-while" command is that it does the sequence before checking the condition, which could result in unnessary tangling of my code.

In this workshop I used the black box test technique, i.e I checked whether my output was correct or not. And the method I applied to debug my code is build and execute method. So, I tried to execute my application and to find the problematic part of code.
